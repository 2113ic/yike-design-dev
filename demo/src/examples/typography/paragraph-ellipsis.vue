    出于对前端组件的好奇，利用业余时间将设计的一个应用提炼出部分设计规范，从而创建出此套对应的前端组件。期望人人都能直面源码，更佳灵活的使用在型项目中。

    Terraria is the land of adventure! It’s a mysterious place! It is a land for
    you to shape, defend and enjoy. In Terraria, your options are endless. Fan
    of action games with itchy fingers? Master architect? collector? Explorer?
    Everyone can find what they are looking for. Start by building a basic
    hideout, then mine for ores and other resources. Explore and craft over 500
    various magical, ranged, melee, and summoned weapons and armor to fight
    hundreds of different enemies. Soon, you will face more than ten huge
    bosses. You can also go fishing, ride mounts, find floating islands, and
    build houses for NPCs. There are many, many things to do.
